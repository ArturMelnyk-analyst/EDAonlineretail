🔍 Key Findings (Top 3 Insights)
🇬🇧 UK Dominates Revenue
The UK alone generated over €14.7M — the bulk of all revenue. Targeting UK-based customers can enhance retention and profits.

🎯 Top Customers Drive Revenue
A small customer segment (e.g., Customer ID 18102) accounts for significant revenue, justifying loyalty programs and VIP strategies.

📦 Return Behavior is Complex
High return volume ≠ high return rate. Segmentation is crucial to treat loyal vs. risky customers differently.
