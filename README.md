## 🔍 Data Source

**Online Retail II Dataset**  
Provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository  
🔗 https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II

This dataset contains transactional data for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.

---

## 📈 Key Insights (from EDA)

- The **UK** is by far the largest contributor to sales volume.
- A small number of products make up the **majority of transactions**.
- There are a significant number of **missing `CustomerID` values**.
- Duplicate rows were found and removed.
- **Quantity and InvoiceDate** trends suggest business cycles and possible seasonality.
